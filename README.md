**True or False**

**True or False**
Assume the value of a is 1 and the value of b is 1.5, and determine whether the condition evaluates to True or False.
1. a ** (5 – 2) > 7
2. 3e-2 < .01 * a
3. (a < b) or (b < a)
4. (a * a < b) or not(a * a < a)
5. not((a < b) and (a < (b + a)))
6. not(a < b) or not (a < (b + a))
7. ((a == b) and (a * a < b * b)) or ((b < a) and (2 * a < b))
8. ((a == b) or not (b < a)) and ((a < b) or (b == a + 1)
9. 3 * a == 2 * b 10. ((5 – a) * b) < 7
10. b <= 3
11. a ** b == b ** a

**Short Answer**
1. Does the condition "Hello " == "Hello" evaluate to True or False?
2. A common error is to replace the condition (not (n 6 m)) with the condition (n > m). The correct replacement is (n >= m).
3. Explain why (27 > 9) evaluates to True, whereas (“27” > “9”) evaluates to False.
